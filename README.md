# Walmate
  *Base16 builder clone*
## Setup
    Sadly this will require a lot of manual work. Also, I am uncertain this will
  work for all systems as I have only tested on my own configs.
  Firstly you will need to get all the base16 folder I created. Will need to
  update with more themes in the future as I did not grab a list from somewhere
  and instead manually grabbed them all.
  
  Simply cd into the base16 folder and run commands. Then copy "schemes" to a
  folder called "walmate" in .config
  
  ```ini
    [Directories]
    build_dir=~/.cache/walmate/
    base16_dir=~/.config/walmate/schemes/
    wallpaper_dir=~/Wallapers/dark/

    [GeneralSettings]
    saturation=0.3
  ```
  
  
  
  FUCK I don't know markdown lol
  let me figure it out
